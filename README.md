### Task 1

In the `data` folder of this repo there is a CSV file called `reactions.csv`. It contains data corresponding to how users have reacted to (saved or skipped) jobs on the platform.

The reaction data consists of four columns:

- `user_id` - the integer ID of the user who liked or disliked the job
- `job_id` - the integer ID of the job the user interacted with
- `direction` - whether the user liked (`true`) or disliked (`false`) the job
- `time` - the timestamp corresponding to when they reacted to the job

**Task**: The similarity score between two users is the number of jobs which they both like. Find the two users with the highest similarity.

**Answer**: _[(1791, 5121), 103)]_

### Task 2

In the `data` folder there is an additional CSV file called `jobs.csv`. It contains unique integer IDs for over 12,000 jobs, along with integer IDs for the job's associated company.

**Task**: The similarity score between two companies is the number of users who like at least one job at both companies. Using both the `reactions.csv` and `jobs.csv` data, find the two companies with the highest similarity score.

**Answer**: _[(46, 92), 92)]_
